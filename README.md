# Would You Rather

## Project Overview

This project is an implementation of the "Would You Rather?" game using React and Redux. Redux is used to manage the overall state of the app.

The app will show a list of answered and unanswered questions. If the user selects an unanswered question, the user will be prompted to provide an answer. If the user selects an answered question, the results of that question will be shown, including how many votes for each option, the percentage for each option and which option the user voted for. The user can also add a new question.

There is also a leader board that scores the users based on how many questions and answers they have provided.
